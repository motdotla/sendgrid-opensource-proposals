# Proposals for SendGrid open source

This document is a moving target and likely temporary. It's a tool to workout brining our open source libraries closer inline together.

## Proposals

[Drop SMTP support from libraries](http://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-opensource-proposals/blob/master/proposals/DROP_SMTP.md)
[Unify naming for SMTPAPI libraries](http://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-opensource-proposals/blob/master/proposals/METHOD_NAMING.md)
