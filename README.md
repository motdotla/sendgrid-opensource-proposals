# Proposals for SendGrid open source

This document is a moving target and likely temporary. It's a tool to workout brining our open source libraries closer inline together.

## Proposals

* -[Drop SMTP support from libraries](http://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-opensource-proposals/blob/master/proposals/completed/DROP_SMTP.md)-
* [Unify naming for SMTPAPI libraries](http://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-opensource-proposals/blob/master/proposals/METHOD_NAMING.md)
